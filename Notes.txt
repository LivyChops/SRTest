Note: I got Proligence.SignalR working after much trial and error - so i'm following Hazza's advice from:
http://orchard.codeplex.com/discussions/531958
to get a hub working.

So far what works, i've:
+ added reference to Proligence.SignalR [PS]
+ added  " Autofac from Lib
+ added  " Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core.dll

Also:
Not sure why, but latest builds arent putting the correct web.config in codegen modules - so I have to copy one
from the other modules and make sure Framework and core aren't referenced to get some razor code to work?
